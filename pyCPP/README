## Changes in the grammar
* function with no return types not allowed.
    eg. 
OLD =>        hello();
    will by default have void type but to remove ambiguity we only allow functions with explicit return type 
NEW =>        void hello()

* write now we can't have multiple declaration specifier
    eg.
        const long int a;
        we can't have declaration like this
